## 📌 Overview  
**CPPS** (C++ Piscine) is an intensive learning period designed to teach **C++ programming fundamentals**, including:  
- Object-oriented programming (OOP)  
- Classes, inheritance, and polymorphism  
- Constructors, destructors, and operator overloading  
- Encapsulation and access control  
- File I/O and exception handling  

The goal is to prepare students for larger C++ projects while reinforcing **modular programming and coding best practices**.
